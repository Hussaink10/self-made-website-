  <h2>How smart is AI in Education</h2>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Groups' decision</h3>
  <p>So based on the assignment report our group has agreed to an answer which was:AI is very smart and that it will help a lot in education.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h3>My opinion</h3>
  <p>Since my part was the Introduction and the Conclusion, I didn't express my opinion much up until the video presentation.</p>
<br><br>
  <h3>My presentation</h3>
  <video id="pvid" width="600" class="video" controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="videos/presentation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  <p class="download-link">
  <a href="videos/presentation.mp4" download="MyPresentation.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Download Video
  </a>
</p>
  <br>
  <p> To be honest not many people said that it will shape the future of education, that was my opinon based on my research because yes i belive AI will take over on almost every aspect</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Simple, imagine being so smart, its great right? what if you become smarter everyday? terrifying? indeed.</p>
  <p>such level of improvment skill will one day make AI very popular more than it is now and that includes education purposes. </p>
